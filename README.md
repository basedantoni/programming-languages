# Programming Languages
In an effort to become the best software engineer I can be, I've decided to revisit common data structures and design patterns. Also I'll be taking a stab at C++, which I have not built any kind of software with.

The goal is to create basic examples of each and also include 1-2 real world usages of each design pattern. Maybe I'll go the extra mile and make some illustrations as well.
